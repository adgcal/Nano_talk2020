Difference between 
- Nanoscience 
- Nanotechnology. 


**Nanoscience** is the study of structures and materials on an ultra-small scale (A nanometre is one billionth of a metre).The physical and chemical properties of matter change at the nano level.


- **Nanotechnology** has the potential to revolutionise a diverse range of fields, from health care to manufacturing,agriculture to environment, textile to sensing.

**$logP = log_{10}[\frac{Cnp(octanol)}{Cnp(water)}]$** </p>
Where, Cnp(octanol) is the concentration of nanoparticles in octanol and
Cnp(water) is the concentration of nanoparticles in water

The  $\zeta$  potential of nanoparticles were measured in a Malvern Nano Z Zetasizer by suspending nanoparticles in Millipore water PH=7.

Nanoparticles (50 μg/ml) were incubated with A549 cells for 24 h. After washing cells three times with phosphate buffered saline, we detached the cells from flask by trypsin-EDTA solution. The cells were counted and then lysed overnight in aqua regia. ICP-MS was used to quantify the concentration of nanoparticles.

Intracellular H2O2 was assessed using the **ROS-GloTM H2O2 assay** (G8820, Promega). The cells were cultured in a 96-well plate overnight. The medium was removed and the cells were treated with the GNPs for solution was added to each well. The cells were kept at 37 ℃ for 22 h before 20 mL of H2O2 substrate 2 h. Afterward, a ROS-Glo detection solution (100 mL) was added to each well and incubated for 20 min at room temperature.The luminescence was determined using a microplate reader.H2O2 (200 μM) was used as a positive control.

For cell association studies, harvested A549 cells were plated onto 24 well plates at ~200000 cells/well and incubated overnight at 37℃ to reach ~80% confluence. Nanoparticles were incubated with cells for 4 h at 37℃. 

Following inclubation, cells in each well were washed four times with sterile PBS supplemented with 0.133 g/l calcium chloride dihydrate and 0.1% bovine serum albumin to remove particles that were free in solution and/or not strongly assoicated with the cell surface.

Total cell association (y) was calculated using the following pseudopartition coefficient: $y = \frac{mcell}{mwell * mcells}$. Where, mcell is the total atomic gold (or silver) content associated with cells, mwell is the total atomic gold (or silver) content in well (associated with cells and free in solution), and mcells is the total mass of magnesium per sample.

In all, $10^{16} nm^2$ nanoparticles were added to 1.0 ml of 10% serum in PBS and incubated at 37℃ for 24 h. The nanoparticles were then washed to remove unbounded serum by centrifugation (500000 g for 30 min at 4℃) three times. Then, 20 μL of mercaptoethanol were added to the pellets, which were then dispersed by ultrasonicated to release abasorbed protein. The nanoparticles were centrifuged at 50000 g for 30 min, and the supernatants containing the isolated protein were quantified by Bradford asay. Briefly, 10 μL of protein isolates were diluted with 20 μL of ultrapure water and transfered 20 μL to a 96 well plate, along with 20 μL aliquots of a BSA serial dilution. Next, 200 μL of Bradford reagent was added to each well, and the plate was mixed on a shaker for 5min at room temperature. Absorbance at 595 nm was measured using a plate reader. The absorbance of the particle-free control was subtracted from samples and total protein concentration calculated relative to the BSA standard.

## Background 
This talk is about a hitchhiker's journey from the curious world of nanoscience to the structured and demand-oriented world of nanotechnology.  



It is a conventional wisdom that science is the source of inspiration and technology is its society or market driven manifestation of the same. In nanoscale the inspiration runs bothways and the boundary of the two is diffused.   


 Often, one has to hitchhike  between these two worlds with  minimal visibility. Every giant step in nanotechnology is thus met with a risk that it may cause  some unknown harm to health and environment. 



## Some stupid questions 

How do we define the concentration of nanoparticles ?

Why size of nanoparticles measured by TEM often differs from that measured by AFM or DLS?

Does nanoparticle alone behave as a drug , pesticide or metabolite?

Can simultaneous measurement of nanoparticle parameters give us more insight in its functional character?

## Some not so stupid questions 

How dimensionality of nanomaterials changes its functional properties?

Are bulk parameters like elasticity, thermal conductivity , impedance meaninful in the nanoscale ?

## Nanotechnology in the pulp and paper industry
(Nanowerk Spotlight) During the past few decades, nanotechnology has had tremendous advances in several areas of research and development. Every week we are witnesses to hundreds of articles and scientific publications reporting new pathways for nanoparticle/nanofiber production, modification and use in modern and high-tech applications. 

In this respect, the pulp and paper industry has not been absent of this development, which has motivated massive research about **nanocellulose**. This wonderful material, which is synthesized naturally in wood, is composed of **nanofibrils with widths usually less than 20 nm**, high aspect ratio and remarkable strength.

A necessary step to realize the above-mentioned applications requires the development of effective industrial production of nanocellulose, with affordable production costs. Nanocellulose can be produced industrially, in large scale (1.5 tonne/day) and with low energy consumption (1600 kWh/tonne). This is considered a significant achievement and implies that nanocellulose from wood can be produced in large quantities, which is a major advantage compared to e.g. bacterial cellulose.

## Medical textiles
Nanofiber-based 'smart' dressings for burn wounds
(Nanowerk Spotlight) Burn injuries are one of the major global health problems. As per a recent report of World Health Organization (WHO), every year 195,000 people from all over the world die because of fire alone. 
Ambroise Pare, a French barber-surgeon devised this system of classification which is based on the depth of a burn injury. As per this system burns can be divided into first, second and third/fourth degrees.


 Due to the advances in the field of nanotechnology, it is now possible to design **nanofiber-based wound dressings (NFDs)** where an electrospun-nanofibrous layer is applied to a basic support fabric material. 
 


- **Haemostasis**: Induce haemostasis due to their nanofibrous structure
- **High filtration & liquid absorption efficiency** Absorb wound exudates efficiently
- **Semi-permeability**: Facilitate cell respiration due to their porosity
- **Conformability**: Facilitate 3-D dressing due to flexibility of ultra-fine nanofibers




## Nano-diamond self-charging batteries could disrupt energy as we know it

California company NDB says its nano-diamond batteries will absolutely upend the energy equation, acting like tiny nuclear generators. They will blow any energy density comparison out of the water, lasting anywhere from a decade to 28,000 years without ever needing a charge. They will offer higher power density than lithium-ion. They will be nigh-on indestructible and totally safe in an electric car crash. And in some applications, like electric cars, they stand to be considerably cheaper than current lithium-ion packs despite their huge advantages.


# Advantages of Printed and Organic Electronics

Until recently, companies have manufactured sensors using conventional semiconductor foundries, which rely on a nine-step process to fabricate each sensor. While well-established, this approach has several downsides: Design-to-production cycles are slow, iteration is costly—as is the per-sensor price—and choice of substrate is limited to rigid materials such as silicon, making such sensors unsuitable for many use cases.
In contrast, printing sensors using roll-to-roll printing methods provides greater choice in functional materials, substrates and deposition methods, offering flexibility of design to accommodate thousands of different applications.
